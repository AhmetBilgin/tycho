# Contributing to Eclipse Tycho

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Try SNAPSHOTs and report issues

To enable SNAPSHOTs, make sure the following Maven repository is available to your build: https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/tycho-snapshots/ .

If you identify an issue, please try to reduce the case to the minimal project and steps to reproduce, and then report the bug with details to reproduce
and the minimal reproducer project to Tycho's [issue tracker](./issues).

## Development environment

Tycho requires Eclipse IDE, Eclipse m2e and Eclipse PDE. Then it can be imported as any Maven project.
